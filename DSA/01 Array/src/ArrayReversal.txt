problem : we need to reverse the array  


step 1 : we wiil take array as an input from user inside main method
(created input array method outside main method )

step 2 : we would create a reverse method such that it would reverse the given passe array 

	Logic : initiate a while loop 
		starting from int i = 0 to 
		arrays middle element 
		conditions : int swap = arr[i]
    		arr [i] = arr[last element]
		arr[last element] = arr[i]

step 3 : we will display array after reversal
(created display array method outside main method )
